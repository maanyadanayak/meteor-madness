## ðŸš€ Features

### 1. Impact Explorer
- **Simulate Meteor Strikes:** Pick a city, adjust meteor size (10mâ€“200m), speed (11â€“70 km/s), and impact angle (15Â°â€“90Â°).
- **Real-time Visualization:** See simulated impacts on a global map, with calculated crater size, shockwave range, and estimated damage.
- **Physics-Based Calculations:** Uses basic physics formulas for realistic results.
- **Global Coverage:** Simulate impacts anywhere on Earth.

### 2. Meteor Customization
- **Custom Parameters:** Users can adjust meteor composition, size, speed, and angle for each simulation.
- **Interactive Controls:** Sliders and inputs let you tweak every aspect of the impact scenario.

### 3. NASA Data Dashboard
- **Live NEO Tracking:** View real-time and historical data for Near-Earth Objects (asteroids and meteors).
- **Hazard Assessment:** See which objects are potentially hazardous.
- **Historical Insights:** Explore past and upcoming close approaches to Earth.
*(Note: This feature is in progress and may show mock data until NASA API is fully integrated.)*

### 4. Fun Mode (Game)
- **Defend Earth:** Use virtual rockets and shields to protect the planet from falling meteors in an arcade-style mini-game.
- **Score Tracking:** Compete for the highest score.
*(Coming Soon)*
